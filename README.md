RoboCourt is a courtroom simulator game. You play a judge seeking truth by interrogating an AI defendant. RoboCourt uses [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho?tab=readme-ov-file) to store conversation history.

This is a quick MVP made for the [AI Infinite Games (Reloaded) Hackathon at Fractal Tech. ](https://lu.ma/ai_infinite_games_reloaded). Future iterations of this game: 

Future iterations of this game:

1) an LA-Noire style detective game/murder mystery where you're investigating crimes and have to interview various suspects. over time as Honcho learns more and more about you as a detective, the suspect agents get tougher and learn to pull on your heartstrings in just the perfect way to fool you, etc. (this is probably the easiest to get to from this demo) 

2) you're a judge hearing cases. you're presented with facts, there are two agents, a prosecution and a defense, they make their cases. you choose which side was more convincing. over time the agents develop a strong theory of mind for you as a judge, and their arguments get more and more convincing. maybe it's a full courtroom drama with witnesses to interview, etc. 

3) papers-please style bureaucracy, maybe you're a ruler, maybe you're still the judge. essentially, the game forces you to make ethical tradeoffs that are tougher and tougher. it starts easy - take money from the treasury to give to the poor? and then it gets harder and harder. pardon a serial killer with dependent children? give donated organs to a respected elder or a sickly child? etc. basically becomes an expert tormentor for the player specifically
